# Database Management System for club member
In this Problem, you have to write an application in Python 3.7 that keeps track of club members and their 
details. A newly opened club house is inviting guests to register into their membership program.
They have received a lot of entries and need help retrieving details of their applicants quickly. 
In order to do this, they need your help in designing a system that can quickly save and find the applicant details based on the applicant’s name.
